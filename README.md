WATE (Web Advanced Text Editor) is a Web-based text editor for use in instances when X-forwarding is not feasible (or possible), and a terminal editor hinders code production.

WATE has several advanced features: a collapsable file-browser, find and replace (and replace all), automatic code indenting, mass indenting, an active documents menu, and more.
